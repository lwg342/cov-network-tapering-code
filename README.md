# Implementation of Generalised Tapering Estimator for High-Dimensional Covariance Matrices

- utils.py contains the class and methods used to compute the generalised tapering estimator. 
- example.py contains an example that compare the performances of different estimators
- simulation.py takes hyperparameters, run nsim simulations, compute the average loss, and save to .pkl files
- report.py takes those .pkl files and produce LaTeX tables and figures.
